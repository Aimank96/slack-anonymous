# Anonymous Bot for Slack

Express your personal thoughts and desires in the depersonalized way concealing your true identity from the rest of your Slack team.

## What it does

When someone posts "/anon Text" in any channel or group, the message is sent to this simple service, which sends the text back to Slack (via Incoming WebHook) with a modified text, omitting the information about the author of the message.

## Deployment

We use Heroku for deployment, but the process should be similar for any other environment.

- Create a new Heroku app
- Point its deployment target to the repository

From the Slack's side:

- Create a new slash-command integration in your team's Slack.
- Set its URL to your Heroku app, i.e. https://myanonymousslackbot.herokuapp.com
- Optionally, copy the autogenerated Token field value of the Slash Command integration, and add it as a configuration parameter SLACK_COMMAND_TOKEN of your Heroku app. This helps to verify that the origin of the command is your team's account and not someone else.
- Create a new Incoming WebHook integration, copy its WebHook URL (something like https://hooks.slack.com/services/****/***) to the configuration parameter POSTBACK_URL of your Heroku app. This lets the anonymous bot to post the message back to your team's Slack account.
- Customize the integration in Slack settings: give it a custom name, icon, etc.
